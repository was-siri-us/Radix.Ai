# Radix.Ai

This project was developed by us (Team Clover) as part of the [HackSavvy'24](https://mgit.ac.in/hacksavvy/) National-level hackathon hosted by [Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology](https://mgit.ac.in/), where we secured 5th placeüèÖ 

## Introduction

Our Project aims to assist Radiologists diagnose diseases accurately and efficiently by:

1. Leveraging Deep Learning to identify pulmonary abnormalities.  

2. Utilizing Grad-CAM to localize and visualize regions corresponding to the identified abnormalities  

3. Implementing transformer models to generate detailed text radiology reports based on the analyzed chest X-ray image.  

4. Integrating the system into a user-friendly Web Application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and Flask APIs, which Radiologists can access for streamlined diagnosis and reporting processes.  

## Dataset
### ChestX-ray14
The ChestX-ray14 dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with 14 disease labels. To evaluate the model, we randomly split the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%) and test (20%) sets, following the work in paper. Partitioned image names and corresponding labels are placed under the directory labels.

### IU X-Ray
IU X-ray (Demner-Fushman et al., 2016) is a set of chest X-ray images paired with their corresponding diagnostic reports. The dataset contains 7,470 pairs of images and reports.

## Web Application

This is a Web application made using the MERN stack. 
- The Login and Register are made secure by using password hashing.
- Incorporates JSON Web Token for authentication after login.
